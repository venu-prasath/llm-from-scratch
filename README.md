# Building an LLM from Scratch

This repository contains code and resources for building a large language model (LLM) from scratch, following the guidance provided in the book ["Building Large Language Models from Scratch"](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

## Overview

This project explores the fundamental steps and techniques required to design and train a GPT-2 level language model from scratch. It aims to:

- Provide hands-on implementation of an LLM architecture.
- Explore dataset preprocessing, tokenization, and training pipelines.
- Understand the challenges of building and scaling LLMs.
- Optimize training workflows for performance and resource efficiency.

## Features

- Implementation of Transformer architecture with attention mechanisms.
- Tokenization and vocabulary creation.
- Efficient data preprocessing pipelines for large-scale datasets.
- Training loop with monitoring and checkpointing.
- Optimization using advanced techniques (e.g., mixed-precision training).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for training)
- Libraries: PyTorch, NumPy, Transformers, Tokenizers, and others (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/venu-prasath/llm-from-scratch.git
   cd llm-from-scratch
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
